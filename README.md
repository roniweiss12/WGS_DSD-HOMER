Homer Pipeline
This repository contains a Nextflow pipeline for performing motif analysis using the Homer tool. The pipeline is designed to process regions and motifs to find motifs in genomic regions and associate them with peaks.

Pipeline Overview
The Homer Pipeline consists of several processes that perform specific tasks:

HomerRegion: This process takes an input region file and prepares it for further analysis by copying it to a Homer-readable format.

HomerFindMotif: This process finds motifs in the given genomic regions using the Homer tool. It generates motif files for both known and novel motifs.

HomerFindPeaks: This process associates the previously identified motifs with peaks using the Homer tool.

Workflow Structure
The workflow structure is as follows:

rust
Copy code
bed-to-homer -> HomerFindMotif -> create-file-for-finding -> HomerFindPeaks -> analysis
bed-to-homer: Converts the input region file to Homer-readable format.
HomerFindMotif: Identifies motifs in the provided genomic regions using Homer.
create-file-for-finding: Prepares motif files for further analysis.
HomerFindPeaks: Associates motifs with peaks using Homer.
analysis: Analysis step (not detailed in the provided script).
Parameters
The pipeline script makes use of various parameters to control its behavior. Some important parameters include:

params.regionFile: The input region file for motif analysis.
params.homerTmp: Temporary directory for Homer.
params.homerFolder: Folder for Homer results.
params.outputDirHomer: Output directory for Homer results.
Running the Pipeline
To run the Homer Pipeline, follow these steps:

Make sure you have Nextflow and the required dependencies (Homer) installed.

Clone this repository to your local machine.

Update the parameters in the pipeline script according to your needs.

Run the pipeline using Nextflow:

bash
Copy code
nextflow run pipeline.nf
